An SSH key is a cryptographic pair of keys (a public key and a private key) used to establish a secure connection between a client (your computer) and a server (like GitHub, GitLab, or a remote server).

It's part of the SSH protocol (Secure Shell), which allows encrypted communication over insecure networks.

Public Key → Shared with others (e.g., GitHub)

Private Key → Stays safe and hidden on your computer

They work together to authenticate you without needing a username and password every time.

The Purpose of SSH Keys:
✅ Authentication: SSH keys prove your identity when you interact with services like GitHub, GitLab, or remote servers. Instead of typing your username and password every time you push code, the SSH key does it for you.

✅ Encryption: They ensure that your communication is secure and encrypted, preventing hackers from eavesdropping on your connection.

✅ Convenience: Once set up, you skip typing passwords repeatedly.

How to Generate an SSH Key (Step-by-Step):

 1. Check for existing SSH keys
 ls -al ~/.ssh
This lists your existing SSH keys (if any). Look for files like:
- id_rsa (private key)
- id_rsa.pub (public key)

2. Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key
Type the following command (replace your email):

"ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

Explanation:

-t rsa → Type of key (RSA)

-b 4096 → Bit strength (4096 bits for stronger security)

-C → Comment (helps identify the key)

3. Step 3: Choose a file location
You'll see this prompt:"

"Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa):"

Just press Enter to accept the default.
Or specify a custom file path if you want multiple keys (for different services).

4. Step 4: Set a Passphrase (Optional):

You'll be prompted to set a passphrase. This adds an extra layer of security (like a password for your private key). You can leave it empty for no passphrase.

5. Step 5: Your Keys Are Generated!
You'll see output like:

Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

✅ id_rsa → Private key (keep this safe, never share it)
✅ id_rsa.pub → Public key (share this with services like GitHub)
