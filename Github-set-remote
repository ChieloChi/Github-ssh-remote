 Before you can push to GitHub, you must have a remote repository linked to your local Git repo.

Here’s the logical flow:

The Typical Workflow:

1️⃣ Create a repository on GitHub
(e.g., go to GitHub - New repository - create my-project)

2️⃣ Create a repository locally (if not already done)

"git init"

3️⃣ Set the Remote

Link your local repo to the GitHub repo.
If you want to use SSH (since you’ve set up your SSH key), use:

"git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/my-project.git"

If you were using HTTPS, it would be:

"git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git"

4️⃣ Push Your Code:

Once the remote is set, you can push:

git push -u origin main
(or master, or whatever branch you’re using)

Summary
✅ You must set the remote before pushing.
✅ If you clone a repo from GitHub, the remote is already set.
✅ If you start from scratch locally, you have to add the remote manually.
✅ For SSH, make sure your remote is in SSH format (git@github.com:...).
